# Xcode File Templates

Some quick templates for C++ in Xcode.

## Installation
Xcode looks for templates in the `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates` directory. To install, just clone this repository inside that directory.

```bash
# Clone the soso templates into a directory named 'soso' inside the templates directory.
git clone git@github.com:sosolimited/Xcode-Templates.git ~/Library/Developer/XCode/Templates/soso
```

## Templates
- Empty File.
- Empty Class.
- Empty Struct.
- EntityX System. Requires [EntityX](https://github.com/alecthomas/entityx) for your project to compile.
- Unit test. Requires [CATCH](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) to build tests.
